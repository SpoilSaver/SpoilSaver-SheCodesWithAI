# SpoilSaver-SheCodesWithAI
SpoilSaver is an AI-powered app empowering seamless, eco-friendly food management. It aims at reducing wasted food and money, with Spoiler Alerts, Grocery Lists and Smart Storage Recommendations.

### How are we working to close the gender gap?
This project is targeted at contributing towards gender equality. As a woman-led company, SpoilSaver contributes to gender equality by promoting women’s representation in the technology and entrepreneurship sectors. Women remain underrepresented in fields like tech and engineering, with only around 25% of computing jobs held by women in the U.S. (National Center for Women & Information Technology, NCWIT). By creating and leading SpoilSaver, we are not only challenging the gender gap in these industries but also providing an example for other women to pursue careers in STEM.

Our team demonstrates the power of women in innovation, combining engineering expertise, data science knowledge, and a commitment to sustainability. As founders, we actively contribute to changing the narrative and providing inspiration for the next generation of women entrepreneurs and tech leaders. Additionally, SpoilSaver’s focus on sustainability and eco-consciousness touches on broader social issues, aligning with our mission to build a future where both women and the planet thrive.

By showcasing women-led leadership in technology and sustainability, SpoilSaver encourages others to take part in creating solutions for pressing global challenges, further driving gender equality in traditionally male-dominated industries.

## What does SpoilSaver do?
SpoilSaver is an AI-powered mobile app designed to help individuals reduce food waste and save money. It offers a suite of features to help users manage their food more effectively. With Smart Storage Recommendations, Spoiler Alerts, and Grocery Lists, SpoilSaver helps users track their food inventory and get notified before items expire, ensuring they can make the most of what they’ve bought. The app uses AI to estimate expiration dates and recommend where to store certain foods to help them last longer, and giving users a clear picture of their food’s freshness by providing real-time insights helping them make smarter decisions about what to eat next.

## How we built it
We built SpoilSaver using a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) alongside Expo and React Native for a powerful, cross-platform mobile experience. Our goal was to create an app that not only helps reduce food waste but also delivers a seamless and engaging user experience.

Frontend (Expo, React Native)
To ensure that SpoilSaver was responsive and accessible across both iOS and Android, we used Expo and React Native. Expo simplified our development process, allowing us to focus on building intuitive features such as:

Smart Storage Recommendations: Helping users store food in the most effective way.
Spoiler Alerts: Alerting users when food is nearing expiration.
Grocery Lists: Allowing users to track what they need and what they have.
These features empowered users to manage their food efficiently, ensuring they reduce waste and maximize the value of what they buy.

Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
On the backend, we used Node.js and Express for handling API requests and app logic, while MongoDB served as the database to store user data like food inventories, expiration dates, and other related information. This infrastructure ensured seamless syncing of data, allowing users to access updated information from multiple devices.

AI Integration with Gemini-Pro
To take our app's capabilities to the next level, we integrated Gemini-Pro, an advanced AI model, which played a central role in generating personalized food details. Gemini-Pro helped us create accurate expiration date predictions and made smart suggestions for food storage and use. The AI model provided:

Recommended Storage Locations: Gemini-Pro analyzes food items and suggests optimal storage conditions (e.g., fridge, pantry, freezer) based on their type.
Expiration Date Estimates: The model predicts expiration dates for various food items, helping users stay ahead of potential waste.
Personalized Recommendations: Based on users' existing food inventory, Gemini-Pro suggests recipes and meal ideas, making it easier for users to use up their ingredients before they spoil.
By leveraging Gemini-Pro’s capabilities, we created a highly intelligent system that dynamically adapts to user preferences and food inventory, enabling users to manage their kitchens with greater efficiency.
